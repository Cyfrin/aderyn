# High Issues

## H-1: Using `delegatecall` in loop

When calling `delegatecall` the same `msg.value` amount will be accredited multiple times.

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 16](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	            target.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doSomething(uint256)", i));
	```



# Low Issues

## L-1: `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 18](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L18)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 22](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 26](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```



## L-2: `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 21](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	        return ecrecover(theHash, v, r, s);
	```



## L-3: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 32](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Lock.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```



## L-4: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in contracts/Counter.sol [Line: 2](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

- Found in contracts/IContractInheritance.sol [Line: 2](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/IContractInheritance.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0;
	```

- Found in contracts/InheritanceBase.sol [Line: 2](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/InheritanceBase.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 2](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Lock.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
	```



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in contracts/Counter.sol [Line: 2](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Counter.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.13;
	```

Assigning values to address state variables without checking for `address(0)`.

- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 58](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L58)

	```solidity
	        addr = newAddr;
	```



## NC-2: Functions not used internally could be marked external



- Found in contracts/Counter.sol [Line: 7](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Counter.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) public {
	```

	```solidity
	    function setAddrNoCheck(address newAddr) public {
	```

- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 61](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L61)

	```solidity
	    function setEmptyAlteredNumbers(uint256 _emptyAlteredPrivateNumber, uint256 _emptyAlteredInternalNumber, uint256 _emptyAlteredPublicNumber) public {
	```

- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 67](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L67)

	```solidity
	    function setNonEmptyAlteredNumbers(uint256 _nonEmptyAlteredPrivateNumber, uint256 _nonEmptyAlteredInternalNumber, uint256 _nonEmptyAlteredPublicNumber) public {
	```



## NC-3: Constants should be defined and used instead of literals



- Found in contracts/Counter.sol [Line: 23](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Counter.sol#L23)

	```solidity
	        number += 2;
	```

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 15](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	```



## NC-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 7](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L7)

	```solidity
	    event DoSomethingElse(uint256 somethingElse);
	```

- Found in contracts/InheritanceBase.sol [Line: 7](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/InheritanceBase.sol#L7)

	```solidity

- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 11](tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Lock.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);
	```
