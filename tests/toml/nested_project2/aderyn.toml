# Aderyn Configuration File
# Help Aderyn work with more granular control

# DO NOT CHANGE version below. As of now, only 1 is supported
version = 1

# Uncomment the example to configure the values.
# If left unspecified, there are reasonable defaults so Aderyn will continue working!

# Base path for resolving remappings and compiling smart contracts, relative to workspace-root (directory in which the editor is open)
# Most of the time, you want to point it to the directory containing foundry.toml or hardhat.config.js/ts.
root = "folder1"

# Path of source directory containing the contracts, relative to root (above)
# Aderyn will traverse all the nested files inside to scan and report vulnerabilities.
# - If not specified, Aderyn will try to extract it from the framework that is being used. (Foundry / Hardhat).
#   That would be "contracts/" in case of Hardhat and "src/" in case of Foundry. Also, sometimes it is automatically
#   derived from foundry.toml and other factors like FOUNDRY_PROFILE environment variable.
# - If specified, Aderyn will override the above configuration.
# Example:
# src = "src/"

# Path segments of contract files to include in the analysis.
# - It can be a partial match like "/interfaces/", which will include all files with "/interfaces/" in the file path.
#   Or it can be a full match like "src/counters/Counter.sol", which will include only the file with the exact path.
# - If not specified, all contract files in the source directory will be included.
# Examples:
# include = ["src/counters/Counter.sol", "src/others/"]
# include = ["/interfaces/"]

# Path segments of contract files to exclude in the analysis.
# - It can be a partial match like "/interfaces/", which will exclude all files with "/interfaces/" in the file path.
#   Or it can be a full match like "src/counters/Counter.sol", which will exclude only the file with the exact path.
# - If not specified, no contract files will be excluded.
# Examples:
# exclude = ["src/counters/Counter.sol", "src/others/"]
# exclude = ["/interfaces/"]

[detectors]
# Detectors to include or exclude. By default, all detectors are run.
# If include is specified, only the specified detectors will be run.
# If exclude is specified, all detectors excluding the specified ones will be run.
#
# Names of the detectors can be found by running `aderyn registry`
# Examples:
# include = ["unused-error", "weak-randomness"]
# exclude = ["costly-loop", "empty-require-revert"]

# For advanced use cases, leverage the following

# Remappings
# - It can be specified in `remappings.txt` within the root folder of the project.
# - If not specified, Aderyn will try to derive the values from foundry.toml (if present.)

# Environment
# - These are usually all the FOUNDRY_, DAPP_ environment variables that are used during development.
# - For example, if different profiles have different `src` declaration in `foundry.toml`, FOUNDRY_PROFILE can dictate the correct `src` value.
#   Env variables and their values can be specified below.

[env]
# Example:
# FOUNDRY_PROFILE = "default"
