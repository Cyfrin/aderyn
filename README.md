## What is Aderyn?

Aderyn is a Solidity Static Analyzer. It takes a bird's eye view over your smart contracts, traversing the Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) to pinpoint suspected vulnerabilities. Aderyn prints out these potential issues in an easy-to-consume markdown format.

## When/Why to Use it?

Use Aderyn when developing or auditing Solidity smart contracts to quickly identify areas where the code may not be following best practices or has potential vulnerabilities.

## Features

* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) support
* Modular [detectors](./src/detect/)
* AST Traversal
* Markdown reports

# Usage

To get started using Aderyn make sure to have Rust installed on your device. For more information, refer to the [official Rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Mac, Linux, Unix

You can install Rust and Cargo by running the following command on your terminal:
  ```sh
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
 ```

## Windows

You can install Rust and Cargo by downloading and running [`rustup-init.exe`](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-gnu/rustup-init.exe).

## Installation

In the command line, run:
```sh
cargo install aderyn
```

## Quick Start

The root path you're running Aderyn on should be either a **Foundry** or compiled **Hardhat** project.

```sh
aderyn /path/to/your/foundry/project/root/directory/
```

That's it! Aderyn identifies whether the project root is a Foundry or Hardhat repo, then uses the compiled AST files to hunt for vulnerabilities. 

`report.md` will be output **in the directory in which you ran the command.**


### Arguments

Usage: `aderyn [OPTIONS] <ROOT>`

Options:
  - `-o`, `--output <OUTPUT>`: Desired file path for the final report (will overwrite existing one) [default: report.md]
  - `-h`, `--help`: Print help
  - `-V`, `--version`: Print version


You must provide the root directory of the repo you want to analyze. Alternatively, you can provide a single Solidity filepath (this mode requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to be installed).

Examples:

```sh
aderyn /path/to/your/foundry/project/root/directory/
```

Run Aderyn in the folder you're currently in:

```sh
aderyn .
```

Output to a different markdown file:

```sh
aderyn -o output.md .
```

Run on a single Solidity file (requires [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to be installed on your machine):

```sh
aderyn src/MyContract.sol
```

## Supported Development Frameworks

If the `<ROOT>` is a directory, Aderyn automatically detects the development framework so long as it's Foundry or Hardhat. 

### Foundry

If Foundry is detected in the project root, Aderyn will first run `forge build` to ensure that the contract compiles correctly and the latest artifacts are available.

### Hardhat

If Hardhat is detected, Aderyn does not auto-compile. Make sure to run `hardhat compile` BEFORE running Aderyn. 

## Single Solidity File Mode

If it is a Solidity file path, then Aderyn will create a temporary Foundry project, copy the contract into it, compile the contract and then analyze the AST generated by that temporary project.

# Roadmap

**Medium-term goals - Auditor Aid:**
* [x] Support Multiple Abstract Syntax Trees representing multiple Solidity files
* [x] Support Foundry/Hardhat/Truffle/Solc output formats for ingesting AST
  * [x] Foundry
  * [x] Hardhat
* [x] Markdown and JSON output
* [x] Yul Support
* [ ] Complexity metrics
* [ ] More complex static analysis detectors
* [ ] auto-fixes
* [ ] installer that doesn't require Rust (aderynup)
* [ ] Python bindings
* [ ] JS/TS bindings
