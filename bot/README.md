# Nyth Project

## What is Nyth?

[Nyth](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn/tree/dev/nyth) is the framework that facilitates the creation of custom bots and detectors for [Aderyn](https://github.com/Cyfrin/aderyn). It abstracts the Aderyn backend so bot developers can focus on what matters most: writing detectors.

## Who is it for?

Nyth is for Solodity Static Analysis Developers and Bot Racers.
