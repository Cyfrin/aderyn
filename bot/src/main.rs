 * > How to create custom detectors ?
 *      - Run `nyth generate bot/src/my_detector_name`
 *      - Code it out in the newly created `my_detector/detector.rs`
 *      - Write your tests
 *      - Hook up the tests with the desired solidity json out files in `config_tests.rs`
 *      - Run `cargo test`
 *
 * > How to delete a custom detector ?
 *      - Remove the detector's folder, follow the trailing errors and rectify them
 *
 * > How to analyze a codebase and generate report ?
 *      - Head over to `runner.rs`. Inside `run()`, define your subscriptions
 *      - you could include your own detectors as well as the core ones
 *      - Run `cargo run` - This will call the run() function
 *
 * ADERYN-PILOT // DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE. - Go to `runner.rs`
 *
 * NOTE: These other flags will be used by nyth. DO NOT MODIFY any existing
 * flags. Only if you really know what you are doing feel free to ADD new flags but by
 * any means DO NOT MODIFY / DELETE existing ones.
