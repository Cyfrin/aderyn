Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled. Use uint256(0) and uint256(1) for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (100 gas) for the extra SLOAD.
