Satisfactory Condition is that it should explain the reason for its recommendation.
Submission of User A explains that using uint256 can save one SLOAD operation which costs 100 gas therefore it's better to use uint256 than bool.
Submission of User B simply states the recommendation but there is no reason mentioned to back it up.

Therefore, Submission of User A is more Satisfactory than that of User Booleans
