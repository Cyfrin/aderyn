# Low Issues

## L-1: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-2: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Inconsistent uint256/uint (or) int256/int types

Inconsistency in declaring uint256/uint (or) int256/int variables within a contract. Use explicit size declarations (uint256 or int256). Consider keeping the naming convention consistent in a given contract. Explicit size declarations are preferred (uint256, int256) over implicit ones (uint, int) to avoid confusion.

	```solidity
	    uint x;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Function Used to Initialize State Variable

Instead of using a function to initialize a state variable in its declaration; declare the state variable and initialize it in the constructor.

	```solidity
	    uint public y = f();
	```

</details>



## L-5: State variable's initial value relies on constructor of another contract.

With via_ir flag is enabled, there is different behavior in contracts where initial value of a state variable relies on the result of the constructor in another contract.
