# High Issues

## H-1: `abi.encodePacked()` Hash Collision

abi.encodePacked() should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`. Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, preventing hash collisions: https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode. (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` instead: https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739. If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

## H-2: `delegatecall` to an Arbitrary Address

Making a `delegatecall` to an arbitrary address without any checks is dangerous. Consider adding requirements on the target address.

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 14](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    function doSomethingElse(address target) external {
	```

</details>



## H-3: Unchecked Low level calls

The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls. Ensure that the return value of a low-level call is checked or logged.

	```solidity
	            target.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doSomething(uint256)", i));
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: `delegatecall` in loop

Using `delegatecall` in loop may consume excessive gas, or worse, lead to more severe issues.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 15](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-2: `ecrecover` Signature Malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

	```solidity
	        return ecrecover(theHash, v, r, s);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Unsafe ERC20 Operation

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	```solidity
	        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```

</details>



## L-4: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
