# High Issues

## H-1: Using `delegatecall` in loop

When calling `delegatecall` the same `msg.value` amount will be accredited multiple times.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 15](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L15)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
	```

</details>



## H-2: `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`

Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred. If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead.

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 18](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L18)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 22](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```

- Found in contracts/KeccakContract.sol [Line: 26](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/KeccakContract.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	        return keccak256(abi.encodePacked(a, b));
	```

</details>



## H-3: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 8](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    uint256 private staticPrivateNumber;
	```

- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 9](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L9)

	```solidity
	    uint256 internal staticInternalNumber;
	```

- Found in contracts/StateVariables.sol [Line: 10](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/StateVariables.sol#L10)

	```solidity
	    uint256 public staticPublicNumber;
	```

</details>



## H-4: Delegatecall made by the function without checks on any adress.

Introduce checks on the address

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 14](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    function doSomethingElse(address target) external {
	```

</details>



## H-5: Unchecked Low level calls

The return value of the low-level call is not checked, so if the call fails, the Ether will be locked in the contract. If the low level is used to prevent blocking operations, consider logging failed calls. Ensure that the return value of a low-level call is checked or logged.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 16](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	            target.delegatecall(abi.encodeWithSignature("doSomething(uint256)", i));
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: `ecrecover` is susceptible to signature malleability

The `ecrecover` function is susceptible to signature malleability. This means that the same message can be signed in multiple ways, allowing an attacker to change the message signature without invalidating it. This can lead to unexpected behavior in smart contracts, such as the loss of funds or the ability to bypass access control. Consider using OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library instead of the built-in function.

- Found in contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol [Line: 21](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/ExtendedInheritance.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	        return ecrecover(theHash, v, r, s);
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in contracts/Lock.sol [Line: 32](../tests/hardhat-js-playground/contracts/Lock.sol#L32)

	```solidity
	        owner.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

Check for `address(0)` when assigning values to address state variables.

</details>



## L-5: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```

</details>



## L-6: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event Withdrawal(uint amount, uint when);
	```

</details>



## L-7: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inilne assembly references it. So if that's not the case, consider removing this unused variable.
