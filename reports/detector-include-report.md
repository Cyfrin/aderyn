# Low Issues

## L-1: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in InconsistentUints.sol [Line: 1](../tests/detector-include/InconsistentUints.sol#L1)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.24;
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unused State Variable

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inline assembly references it. Consider removing this unused variable.
