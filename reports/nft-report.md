# Low Issues

## L-1: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

- Found in src/F1.sol [Line: 3](../tests/foundry-nft-f23/src/F1.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.10;
	```

</details>



## L-2: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

- Found in src/BasicNft.sol [Line: 18](../tests/foundry-nft-f23/src/BasicNft.sol#L18)

	```solidity
	    function mint() public {
	```

- Found in src/Initializer.sol [Line: 8](../tests/foundry-nft-f23/src/Initializer.sol#L8)

	```solidity
	    function get_start_token_id() public pure returns(uint256) {
	```

</details>



## L-3: PUSH0 Opcode

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

- Found in src/F1.sol [Line: 3](../tests/foundry-nft-f23/src/F1.sol#L3)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.10;
	```

</details>



## L-4: Unused Import

Redundant import statement. Consider removing it.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/F1.sol [Line: 5](../tests/foundry-nft-f23/src/F1.sol#L5)

	```solidity
	import "./F2.sol";
	```

</details>



## L-5: State Variable Could Be Constant

State variables that are not updated following deployment should be declared constant to save gas. Add the `constant` attribute to state variables that never change.
